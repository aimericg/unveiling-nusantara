<h2>CULTURAL CRINGE</h2>
<p>
  Warung banners portray a large facette of Indonesia’s ‘common informal’. They
  are characterized by large headings, all-caps text, stretched/distorted
  typefaces, effects, and gradients which from a Western graphic design
  perspective can give the impression of aggressive shouting. They are therefore
  often overlooked or undervalued under more common views associated with the
  International/Swiss style and minimalism. However, their designs do have their
  importance in local culture, as exemplified by the iconic Lamongan Pecel Lele
  warung banners, serving as a vibrant symbol of the regional identity and
  street food culture of East Java.This Western critical eye finds its sense
  when relating it to A.A. Philip's theory of cultural cringe, which Filipino
  cultural worker Clara Balaguer defines as the phenomenon "by which the culture
  produced in an ex-colonial or colonial country is seen as inferior to that
  being produced in the colonial seat," This is furthermore accentuated by
  Novreica “the opulence of these Indonesian-styled graphics is sometimes
  overlooked, forgotten, and even underestimated because of the assumptions of
  them being low-brow or kitschy.” How can cultural cringe be countered? How can
  these colonial traps be avoided? The focus of study should be shifted towards
  prioritizing ‘local’ cultures rather than the study of Western concepts first.
  Novreica emphasizes that “Indonesian ephemeras deserve to be used as a primary
  source for further research– which offers unique windows into cultures past.”
  By digging deeper into Indonesian ephemeras and artifacts, we can uncover the
  stories and designs that make Indonesian culture unique.
